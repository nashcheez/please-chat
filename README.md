<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://nashcheez.github.io/please-chat/)

Please Chat is an application similar to WhatsApp Web/iMessage featuring a two column layout which has a list of friends and compose box on the left column, and chat history on the right.

### Key Features

-   The application lets you search for a friend and start a chat with him. The user interface is inspired from the iMessage application on the Mac OS.

-   One can send a message and see the replies echoed in a typical message format. Switching between friends lets you instantly see the corresponding chat history.

-   Error handling has been implemented where apt error messages are displayed (connection closure, network failure etc).

-   There is a toggle to switch between the connection status (online/offline).

-   The app has an object oriented architecture implementing encapsulation and all the global variables & functions are attributed to a single `pleaseChat` object.

### Built With

The application has been developed using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

A [WebSocket echo service](https://www.websocket.org/echo.html) has been used to fetch the chats & acts as the connection layer.

For more information about jQuery, please visit the official docs.

-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

### Installation

2. To run the application locally you will need to change the WebSocket connection from `wss` to `ws`. See [why](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46557485/difference-between-ws-and-wss).

```
